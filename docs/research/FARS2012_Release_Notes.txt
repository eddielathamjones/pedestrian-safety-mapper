===================================
FARS National and Puerto Rico Files
-----------------------------------
The FARS Files directory structure has been modified and made consistent across all years, beginning with 1975.  
In each folder, there are two zip files, one in SAS format and one in CSV format.

Auxiliary files are included in the SAS and CSV sets instead of as independent zip files.
==========================
FARS Auxiliary Files
--------------------
The FARS Auxiliary files are datasets that are derived from the standard FARS datasets: 
1. Accident -> Acc_Aux
2. Vehicle -> Veh_Aux
3. Person -> Per_Aux
These files are joined by the standard key variables.
