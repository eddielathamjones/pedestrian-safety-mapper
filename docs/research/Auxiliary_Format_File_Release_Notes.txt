FARS Auxiliary Files
LAST CHANGE: 4/12/2024
--------------------------

The FARS Auxiliary files are datasets that are derived from the standard FARS datasets.

They contain data elements that have been standardized to allow for simpler use of the data and for trending analysis.

1. Accident -> Acc_Aux
2. Vehicle -> Veh_Aux
3. Person -> Per_Aux

These files are joined by the standard key variables.

Please read the following document for additional details: http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/811364.pdf

For SAS Format Catalog, please go to: ftp://ftp.nhtsa.dot.gov/FARS/Auxiliary_FARS_Files_Formats

    Format files are available for SAS Viya 64-bit environments or simply run Auxiliary_Formats.sas program file to create the format catalog file. 

An updated FARS Auxiliary Analytical User Manual is pending and will be available soon.
