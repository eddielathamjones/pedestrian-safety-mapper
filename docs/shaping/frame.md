# Pedestrian Safety Mapper — Frame

## Source

> Going to work on this https://github.com/eddielathamjones/pedestrian-safety-mapper — I feel this is stalled out and needs help.
>
> Stall feels like: scope feels overwhelming.
> Primary use: both portfolio + real tool.
> The full vision (MapBox, PostGIS, Flask, D3, filters, time-series) is too big to see a path through.

## Problem

The project has all the raw FARS data (1975–2022) downloaded and a clear long-term vision, but no working application code. The full stack — Flask/Django, PostgreSQL/PostGIS, MapBox GL JS, D3 time-series, filters, reports — is too large to start all at once. Without a working end-to-end thing, the project stalls.

---

## Outcome

A working, demo-able web application that:
1. Puts real FARS pedestrian fatality data on an interactive map
2. Is polished enough to show in a portfolio
3. Is genuinely useful to planners, advocates, or researchers exploring fatality patterns

The immediate goal is momentum: something real running end-to-end that can grow into the full vision.
